When I was younger I took an interest in the immense world wide web, and I was heavily involved on multiple websites, which allowed me to explore different aspects of what made the internet the internet. Eventually I found myself on websites like Myspace and Neopets (very different, I know), which unbeknownst to me led me to front end coding with HTML and CSS, simply because I wanted my pages to look "cool" and have features on them that none of my friends had on their pages. As I got older I explored the blogging site Tumblr, which allowed me to extend my little bit of knowledge of coding into altering the themes (the layouts) of my blog.

As far as back end coding goes, I never really had any direct experience with it. However, I've always had an idea of it because my father has been heavily involved in computer science for my entire life, and he runs a telecommunications business. It's definitely a different animal, but I'm enjoying learning it.

So, to get back to the original question: “Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?" Well, I got my Bachelor's degree in Entertainment Business when I was 21 years old, and while it's definitely an accomplishment, I can't help but regret not having gone down a different path with my education at that age. A few years ago I dabbled in learning code on and off again because I figured it would be a practical skillset to have in today's ever-changing technological world, but I never really took it seriously. Eventually I found myself at an existential fork where I had to decide, "Do I want to go to Grad school for Law, or do I revisit learning a skillset that would be constantly useful and allow me to go in different directions with any company I chose to work for?" After researching the amount of debt that attorneys aquire and seeing that being a lawyer was ranked as one of the top most miserable jobs in the country, I decided that learning to code was probably the smarter choice. 

It as at this point where I found a CNBC Millenial Money piece on a 25 year old women named Bukola Ayodele. Although our lives are completely different, she found herself in a similiar path as myself where she also wanted to go to Law school, but instead self taught herself code and is now making over $200k a year in New York City working in Financial Tech as a software engineer. This was extremely inspiring for me, and I finally took the steps I needed to in order to progress with this career decision. 

To sum it up: I want to learn an ever-changing, versatile skillset that constantly challenges me; I want to be able to work for almost any company that I choose to because there is always an necessity for software engineers; and I want financial freedom.
